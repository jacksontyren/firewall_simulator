<h1>ðŸ”¥ðŸ§±Firewall Simulator with Python</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, I will build a simple firewall simulator to explore the fundamental logic behind firewalls. This project is a the starting point for developing a progressively functional firewall, gaining a deeper understanding of their operations.</p>
    <p>In this project, I will specifically accomplish the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Define a set of firewall rules using a Python dictionary.</li>
        <li>Generate random IP addresses to simulate network traffic.</li>
        <li>Check each IP address against the firewall rules.</li>
        <li>Print the result (allowed or blocked) for each IP address based on the rules.</li>
    </ol>
<br />


<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Python programming language</b>
